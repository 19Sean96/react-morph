# Fade in Fade out

## Intro

When creating complex morph animation some elements can simply fade in or fade out.
This would make more pleasent animations since there will be less cognitive load to
process all the movements.

Import the `useFade` hook.

```js
import { useFade } from 'react-morph';
```

Call the hook in you function component.

```js
const fade = useFade(options);
```

Then spread the props to the elements you want to fade.

```jsx
<img {...fade} src="larva.png" width="50">
```

## Simple fade

<Playground>
  {() => {
	  // Handle toggle state as you normally would.
	  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)
		const spring = { damping: 5, stiffness: 10 };
    const fadeIn = useFade({ spring, isInitial: toggle, delaysRatio: 1 });
    const fadeOut = useFade({ spring, isInitial: !toggle });

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setToggle(!toggle)}>Let's fade!</button>

    			<br />

          {toggle ? (
            <img key="one" {...fadeIn} src={larva} width="80"  style={{ float: 'left'}}/>
          ) : (
            <img key="two" {...fadeOut} src={butterfly} width="80" style={{ float: 'right'}} />
          )}
      </div>
    )}}

</Playground>

## Disable initial fade

Usually when you create a complex morph with some fades, we just want to fade in/out when toggle.
In order to disable the initial fade in on page load you can toggle the option `isInitial`.

Normally you will set the `isInitial` option on the initial state and disable it to the final state.

```js
useFade({ isInitial: toggle });
```

## Delay

By default `useFade` delays the fade in and speeds up the fade out.
This is expecially useful to use with `useMorph`.

To update this behaviour you can set the option `delaysRatio`.
The default value is `0.1`. To disable the delay set `delaysRatio` to `1`.
