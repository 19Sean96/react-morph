# React Morph Ô∏èü¶ã

#### Morphing UI transitions made simple

Magically animates one element into another just by tagging the first and last state.

## Getting Started üêõ

Import the `useMorph` hook.

```js
import { useMorph } from 'react-morph';
```

Call the hook in you function component.

```js
const morph = useMorph(options);
```

Then spread the props to the elements you want to morph.

```jsx
<img {...morph} src="larva.png" width="30">
```

```jsx
<img {...morph} src="butterfly.png" width="80">
```

You should handle the state as you normally would for mounting and unmounting the elements.

> Make sure you have just **ONE element rendered at same time**.

<Playground>
  {() => {
	  // Handle toggle state as you normally would.
	  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(true)
	  const morph = useMorph();

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => setToggle(!toggle)}>Let's morph!</button>

  				<br />
          {toggle && <img key="one" {...morph} src={larva} width="30" height="30" />}
  				<br />
  				<br />
  				<br />
          {!toggle && <img key="two" {...morph} src={ butterfly} width="80" height="80" style={{ float: 'right' }} />}
        </div>
      )
    }
}
</Playground>

## Controling the state

React morph doesn't handle the state for you. There is no play or stop method.

Also, it won't hide or show the elements for you. It's up to you how you want to handle it.

The animation will be triggered as soon as the new element with the same `{...morph}` enters the DOM.

That's why you cannot have the two state elements at the same time.

The elements can use `useState`

```js
{
  toggle ? (
    <img {...morph} src={larva} width="30" />
  ) : (
    <img {...morph} src={butterfly} width="80" />
  );
}
```

But also you can use `react-router`
