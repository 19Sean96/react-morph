# React Morph Ô∏èü¶ã

#### Morphing UI transitions made simple

## Getting Started

Import the `useMorph` hook.

```js
import { useMorph } from 'react-morph';
```

Call the hook in you function component.

```js
const morph = useMorph(options);
```

Then spread the props to the elements you want to morph.

```jsx
<img {...morph} src="larva.png" width="50">
```

```jsx
<img {...morph} src="butterfly.png" width="80">
```

You should handle the state as you normally would.

> Make sure you have just **ONE element redered at same time**.

<Playground>
  {() => {
	  // Handle toggle state as you normally would.
	  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(true)
	  const morph = useMorph();

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => setToggle(!toggle)}>Let's morph!</button>

  				<br />
          {toggle && <img key="one" {...morph} src={larva} width="30" height="30" />}
  				<br />
  				<br />
  				<br />
          {!toggle && <img key="two" {...morph} src={ butterfly} width="80" height="80" style={{ float: 'right' }} />}
        </div>
      )
    }
}
</Playground>

## Controling the state

React morph doesn't handle the state for you. There is no play or stop method.

Also, it won't hide or show the elements for you. It's up to you how you wanna handle it.

The animation will be triggered as soon as the new element with the same `{...morph}` enters the DOM.

That's why you cannot have the two state elements at the same time.

## Styling

You can style your components however you like.
You can use inline styles, class names or a CSS-in-JS solution like Styled Components.
